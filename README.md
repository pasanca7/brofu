# Brofu

Brofu is a football trivia game where the goal is to guess players from legendary team seasons.  
Examples include iconic squads.

Players will face challenges that test their memory and knowledge of football history,  
trying to recall who was part of these historic line-ups.

The project consists of:

- **Backend** built with FastAPI and async SQLAlchemy to manage players, levels (team + season), and game logic.
- **Frontend** built with React and Vite for a fast and responsive user interface.
- **Database** powered by PostgreSQL, with Alembic for migrations and data versioning.

Brofu is designed to be efficient, scalable, and easily expandable with new legendary teams,  
game modes, and features.
